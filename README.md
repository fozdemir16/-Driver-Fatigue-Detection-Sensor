  # Driver-Fatigue-Detection-Sensor
 ## Driver Fatigue Detection Sensor with Python, OpenCV and Raspberry PI



# SUMMARY
Today, a high proportion of traffic accidents are accidents caused by fatigue. A system
is needed to warn drivers when they are tired or falling asleep. With this developed
system, a system that monitors the driverâ€™s eye conditions, understands driver fatigue
and gives an audible warning has been developed. In this system, the Raspberry Pi 3B+
model is used, while the Raspberry Pi camera module is used to capture images and
a speaker is used for audio. Python, OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library,
Open Source Computer Vision Library) and machine learning libraries were used to
create the algorithm that understands driver fatigue. Haar Cascade classifier was used
to detect eyes and faces, and whether the face was detected and whether the eyes were
open or closed were determined. Fatigue was detected according to the time the eyes
were closed, and an audible warning was given to the person.
